Well, as of July 13, 2021, USC has put this policy in place to help you make the most of your personal brand while still playing by the rules. It's all about empowering you to earn some cash from your name, image, and likeness without compromising your status as a student-athlete.\n\nToday, we're going to cover the ins and outs of this policy, so you can confidently navigate the world of NIL opportunities.

There's a whole world of opportunities out there, and we want you to make the most of them!\n\nHere are some examples of what's allowed:\n\n1. Appearing in ads: Imagine Isaiah Mobley starring in a commercial for a local pizza joint. That's totally cool!\n2. Selling autographs: If fans want to pay for your signature, go for it!\n3. Running camps or clinics: Let's say Tahj Eaddy wants to host a basketball camp for kids. That's a great way to earn some extra cash and give back to the community.\n4. Making personal appearances: If a local business wants to pay you to show up at their grand opening, that's fair game.\n\nBut remember, these activities shouldn't interfere with your team commitments or your classes. We don't want you missing practice or skipping an exam for a photoshoot!\n\nNow, here's what's NOT allowed:\n\n1. \"Pay-for-play\" deals: You can't get paid just for being on the team or for how well you play in games.\n2. Recruiting bribes: No one can offer you money to come to USC or stay at USC.\n3. Fake deals: You can't accept money for work you're not actually doing.\n\nFor example, if a booster offered Drake London $10,000 just to catch touchdowns in the next game, that would be a big no-no. But if a sports drink company wanted Drake to promote their product on Instagram? That's totally fine!",

It doesn't matter if it's a big contract or just a small gig, written or verbal - you've got to spill the beans.\n\nHere's how you do it:\nFirstly, Use the INFLCR app to submit a disclosure form.\nSecondly, Wait for USC to review it and make sure there are no conflicts.\nThirdly, don't finalize anything until USC gives you the thumbs up.\n\nLet's say Onyeka Okongwu (when he was at USC) got offered a deal to promote a new basketball shoe. Before he signs anything, he'd need to submit the details through the INFLCR app. USC would then check to make sure it doesn't conflict with our Nike deal. Once USC says it's all good, Onyeka could move forward with the deal.\n\nThis might seem like a hassle, but it's actually there to protect you. We don't want you accidentally signing a deal that could get you in trouble with NCAA's rules or conflict with USC's agreements."

This includes our uniforms, logos, and even photos of you in USC gear.\n\nThe golden rule here is: Always ask for permission before using any USC marks in your NIL deals.\n\nHere's a quick rundown:\nFirstly, Want to use USC stuff? Submit a request through the INFLCR app.\nSecondly, Wait for written approval from USC.\nLastly, Only use what's specifically approved.\n\nFor example, let's say Evan Mobley (when he was at USC) wanted to sell t-shirts with his name and the USC logo. He'd need to work with a USC-approved licensee and get permission from USC first. But what if he just wanted to describe himself as a \"USC basketball player\" in his Instagram bio? That's usually okay without special permission.\n\nRemember, USC won't approve anything that conflicts with our existing sponsorships or involves stuff like gambling, drugs, or anything else that might make the university look bad.\n\nIf you're not sure, just ask! We're here to help you navigate this stuff."

I'm Sam, and I'm here to talk to you about something that might not seem exciting at first, but is incredibly important for your financial future: taxes.\n\nNow, you might be wondering, \"Why do I need to care so much about taxes? I'm just a college athlete.\" Well, let me tell you a story that might change your perspective.\n\nIn 2012, Warren Sapp, a former NFL star, filed for bankruptcy. Despite earning over $40 million during his career, he owed $6.7 million to creditors, including $942,000 in back taxes. This isn't an isolated incident. Many professional athletes have faced similar fates due to mismanagement of their finances, particularly when it comes to taxes.\n\nAs student athletes in the era of NIL deals, understanding taxes is more crucial than ever. Your actions now can set you up for financial success or struggle later in life. So, let's dive in with a foundational understanding of taxes.\n\nA quick disclaimer before we start, I just want to make sure we're also clear. This is not tax advice that you should rely on. If there's anything that we talk about that's interesting to you, feel free to seek out a competent tax advisor. We don’t provide any tax advice but only general knowledge about taxes."

                      "transcript": "Let’s start with the Taxable versus Non-taxable.\n\nBy default, all income is taxable unless something in the US tax law says it’s not.\n\nSo I'll give you an example. There's a very famous case on this. Where somebody found money in a piano, so they bought a piano. They open it up a few years later, and they find a wad of money. And the case went to court, but essentially the court said that money is taxable. Found money is taxable so if you find $100 on the street, you pick it up and put it in your pocket, that's taxable income.\n\nWhether people actually report found money on their tax returns is a different discussion. Today, we're focusing on the legal requirements and compliance, not on what individuals choose to declare in practice. The key point is that, according to the law, found money is considered taxable income.\n\nAnother example related to student athletes, they are getting gift cards, swag bags, free gear, you know, free anything in exchange for appearance fees or endorsements that's taxable income to them. So income doesn't have to just be cash.\n\nHere's some examples of things that are non-taxable in the law: gifts, scholarships, resident assistant wages, athletic uniforms.\n\nGifts from family aren't taxable, but be careful - not everything called a 'gift' is truly a gift. If I ask a student athlete to take a selfie and give them a gift card, that's actually taxable income. Why? Because they did something in exchange. A real gift comes with no strings attached. If there's an expectation of something in return, it's likely taxable income.\n\nNow, for you students, there are a few other things to know. Scholarships? Usually not taxable if you use them for tuition, fees, books, and stuff you need for class. For Resident Assistant, if you're getting free room and board for being an Resident Assistant, there's actually a rule that says that's not taxable.\n\nOh, and for student athletes - those uniforms they gave you are also not taxable.\n\nJust remember, we're not covering everything here, but these are the big ones you should know about."

Basically, any time you make money, you have to give a portion of it to the government to help pay for their services and programs. This is called income tax.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the government agency in charge of collecting taxes.\n\nAs USC student athletes in California, you'll primarily encounter:\n\n- **Federal Income Tax**: A percentage of your earnings that goes to the U.S. government.\n- **California State Income Tax**: An additional percentage that goes to the state of California. Remember, California has some of the highest state income tax rates in the country.\n- **Social Security and Medicare Taxes**: These fund programs for retirees and healthcare for older Americans.\n- **Los Angeles City Tax**: While LA doesn't have a city income tax, there are various local taxes you might encounter, like sales tax on purchases.\n\nLet's say you sign a $5,000 NIL deal with a local LA sports apparel company. You might be excited about that full amount, but remember:\n\n- Federal tax could take about 22% ($1,100)\n- California state tax could take about 9.3% ($465)\n- You might need to set aside money for self-employment tax as well\n\nSo from that $5,000, you might only keep about $3,000 after taxes. This is why understanding taxes is crucial for managing your finances effectively.\n\n**Capital gains taxes**: If you have investments, you’ll need to report any income you made from them so you can pay capital gains tax, which is tax on the profit you made from an investment. For example, if you buy shares of a stock for $1,000 and sell them for $3,000, you’ll pay capital gains tax on the $2,000 profit. The rate you’ll pay in capital gains tax depends on how long you’ve held an investment. Generally, short-term capital gains taxes apply to assets sold less than a year after you bought them. They are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate. Long-term capital gains taxes apply to assets sold a year or more after purchase, and they’re taxed at a lower rate."

Your filing status affects which forms you'll need to complete, your tax brackets, and ultimately how much you'll owe or receive as a refund.\n\nLet's explore the five tax statuses and how they might apply to you as a student athlete.\n\n**Single**\n\nMost student athletes will likely fall into this category. If you're not married and don't have any dependents (i.e., you don't financially support anyone else), you'll file as single.\n\nPerks of filing as single for student athletes:\n\n- Simpler tax return, which is beneficial if you're juggling academics, athletics, and NIL deals.\n- Potentially lower tax brackets, especially important if you're earning significant income from NIL deals.\n\n**Head of Household**\n\nThis status is less common for student athletes but could apply if you're supporting a qualifying person, such as a child, parent, or other relative, while in school.\n\nExamples:\n\n- If you're a student athlete with a child and you pay more than half the cost of maintaining your home, you might qualify for this status.\n- If you're a student athlete supporting a parent who lives with you and you provide more than half of their support, you could potentially qualify for Head of Household status.\n\nRequirements to claim a parent as a dependent for Head of Household status:\n\n- Your parent must be a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, U.S. resident alien, or a resident of Canada or Mexico.\n- You must pay more than half of the cost of maintaining your parent's main home for the entire year.\n- Your parent's gross income must be less than the exemption amount ($4,400 for 2023).\n- Your parent cannot file a joint return with someone else unless it's only to claim a refund.\n\nBenefits:\n\n- More favorable tax brackets\n- Larger standard deduction, which could be beneficial if you're earning from NIL deals\n- Potential for additional credits and deductions\n\n**Married Filing Jointly**\n\nFor married student athletes, this status allows you and your spouse to submit one tax return combining your incomes.\n\nConsiderations for student athletes:\n\n- If your spouse also has income, combining it with your athletic scholarship and NIL earnings could push you into a higher tax bracket.\n- However, you may be eligible for more deductions and credits, potentially offsetting the higher income.\n\n**Married Filing Separately**\n\nSome married student athletes might choose this option, especially if one spouse has significant NIL earnings or complicated financial situations.\n\nExample: If you're earning substantial NIL income but your spouse is not, filing separately might keep your spouse's tax liability lower.\n\nCaution: This status often means fewer deductions and credits, so calculate carefully before choosing this option.\n\n**Qualifying Surviving Spouse**\n\nWhile less common among student athletes, this status could apply if you've lost a spouse and have a dependent child.\n\nFor student athletes:\n\n- This status allows you to use the favorable joint filing tax rates for up to two years after your spouse's passing.\n- This could be particularly beneficial if you're managing NIL income along with your loss."

While there are some exceptions (depending on personal factors like your age and financial situation), if you don’t file before the April 15 deadline, you could face fines and penalties! So let’s take a look at how to make filing as quick and easy as possible.\n\n**Ways to File**\n\nThere are three main ways you can file your taxes as a USC student athlete:\n\n1. **Directly with the IRS**\n2. **Using online tax software**\n3. **Using an in-person tax preparer**\n\nEach method has different costs and benefits, particularly relevant to your unique situation as a student athlete.\n\n**File Directly**\n\nMany USC student athletes can file their federal taxes for free! The IRS Free File forms allow you to fill out your tax forms by mail or electronically (e-filing). This can be a good option if you have a simple tax situation, perhaps with just scholarship income and a small NIL deal.\n\nHowever, be cautious: if you have multiple NIL deals or complex income sources, this method might not be the best choice as it provides no guidance on athlete-specific tax issues.\n\n**Tax Software**\n\nOnline tax software services can be particularly helpful for USC student athletes. Many of these services have specific sections for reporting NIL income and understanding the tax implications of your athletic scholarship. They can help you navigate questions like:\n\n- Is your scholarship taxable?\n- How do you report income from social media promotions?\n- What expenses related to your sport might be deductible?\n\nWhile these services come at a cost, they're usually cheaper than an in-person preparer and can provide valuable guidance for your unique situation.\n\n**Tax Preparer**\n\nFor USC student athletes with significant NIL deals or complex tax situations, a professional tax preparer might be the best option. Look for preparers who have experience with athlete taxes. They can help you:\n\n- Properly report all sources of income\n- Understand the tax implications of multi-state competitions\n- Maximize deductions related to your athletic activities\n- Plan for future tax years as your NIL income potentially increases\n\n**Costs and Services**\n\nAs a USC student athlete, your tax situation may be more complex than the average student. Here's a general guide:\n\n- If you only have scholarship income and maybe one small NIL deal, you might be able to file for free using IRS Free File.\n- If you have multiple NIL deals but they're relatively straightforward, tax software might be your best bet. Look for services that specifically mention support for student athletes.\n- If you have significant NIL income, are dealing with multi-state issues, or have other complex tax situations, investing in a professional tax preparer could save you money and stress in the long run.\n\nRemember, USC's Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program might be able to help if you meet their income requirements. They have experience with student athlete tax issues and can be a great free resource.\n\nUltimately, choose a method that gives you confidence in properly reporting your income and maximizing your deductions. As your athletic career progresses and your financial situation becomes more complex, don't hesitate to seek more comprehensive tax help."

The company pays you $100 per month.\n\n**Tax Implications**:\n\n- This $1,200 annual income is taxable.\n- You may need to make estimated tax payments quarterly if your total tax liability is expected to be $1,000 or more.\n- Keep detailed records of all income and related expenses.\n\n**How to handle it**:\n\n- Create a separate bank account for your NIL earnings.\n- Save all contracts and payment receipts.\n- Track any expenses related to this deal (e.g., travel costs to photoshoots).\n- Use IRS Form 1040-ES to calculate and pay estimated taxes quarterly.\n- Report this income on Schedule C of your Form 1040 at tax time.\n\n**Scenario 2: Free Gear**\n\nAs a USC basketball player, a local shoe store sends you $500 worth of shoes and apparel to wear and promote.\n\n**Tax Implications**:\n\n- The fair market value of these items ($500) is considered taxable income.\n- You'll need to report this on your tax return, even though you didn't receive cash.\n\n**How to handle it**:\n\n- Get a written statement from the company detailing the items and their retail value.\n- Keep a log of when and how you use these items for promotional purposes.\n- Report this as \"Other Income\" on Line 8 of Form 1040.\n- Consider consulting with USC's compliance office to ensure this arrangement doesn't violate NCAA rules.\n\n**Scenario 3: Appearance Fees**\n\nYou're a USC swimmer paid $50 to appear at a local youth sports camp for a meet-and-greet.\n\n**Tax Implications**:\n\n- This $50 is taxable income.\n- If you have multiple such appearances, keep a log of dates, locations, and amounts earned.\n\n**How to handle it**:\n\n- Create a spreadsheet to track all appearances, including date, location, payer, and amount.\n- Save any contracts or agreements related to these appearances.\n- If total miscellaneous income exceeds $400, report it on Schedule C.\n- If less than $400, report on Line 8 of Form 1040 as \"Other Income\".\n\n**Scenario 4: YouTube Channel**\n\nAs a USC volleyball player, you start a YouTube channel about your life as a student athlete. It generates $800 in ad revenue over the year.\n\n**Tax Implications**:\n\n- This $800 is taxable self-employment income.\n- You may be able to deduct certain expenses related to creating content.\n- You'll likely need to pay self-employment tax (15.3%) in addition to income tax.\n\n**How to handle it**:\n\n- Keep meticulous records of all income from the channel.\n- Track all expenses related to creating content (e.g., camera equipment, editing software).\n- Report this income and expenses on Schedule C.\n- Use Schedule SE to calculate self-employment tax.\n- Consider making quarterly estimated tax payments using Form 1040-ES.\n\n**Scenario 5: Scholarship and Stipends**\n\nYou receive a partial athletic scholarship worth $5,000 and a $500 stipend for living expenses.\n\n**Tax Implications**:\n\n- The portion of the scholarship for tuition, fees, and required books is typically tax-free.\n- The stipend for living expenses is usually taxable income.\n\n**How to handle it**:\n\n- Obtain a detailed breakdown of your scholarship from USC's financial aid office.\n- Report the $500 stipend as taxable income on your Form 1040.\n- If you receive a Form 1098-T from USC, use this to help calculate the taxable portion of your scholarship."

After his NFL career, he didn't just rely on his playing salary. He became a successful venture capitalist, investing in startups and tech companies. This shows how smart investing can extend your financial \"playing field\" long after your athletic career ends.\n\nAnother Example:\n\nThink of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps.

Let's break down investment goals into three timeframes:\n\n**Short-term Goals (0-3 years):**\n\n- **Examples:** Post-season vacation, new training equipment, or emergency fund\n- For USC athletes, this might include saving for:\n  - A celebratory trip after winning a championship\n  - High-quality recovery gear to enhance performance\n  - Building a 6-month emergency fund for unexpected expenses\n- **Strategy:** Use low-risk, highly liquid investments like high-yield savings accounts or money market funds\n- **Remember:** The goal here is preservation of capital, not high returns\n\n**Medium-term Goals (3-10 years):**\n\n- **Examples:** Down payment on a home, starting a business, or graduate school\n- For USC athletes, consider:\n  - Saving for a down payment on a home in LA's competitive real estate market\n  - Funding for a sports-related business venture after graduation\n  - Preparing for potential graduate studies or professional certifications\n- **Strategy:** Mix of moderate-risk investments like a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds\n- Aim for a balance between growth and capital preservation\n\n**Long-term Goals (10+ years):**\n\n- **Primary example:** Retirement planning\n- For USC athletes, think about:\n  - Building wealth to maintain your lifestyle after your athletic career\n  - Creating generational wealth for your family\n  - Funding philanthropic goals or starting a foundation\n- **Strategy:** Higher allocation to growth-oriented investments like stocks or real estate\n- Take advantage of compound interest over time\n\n**Real-life Example: Michael Strahan**\n\nWhile not a USC Trojan, Michael Strahan provides an excellent example of strategic long-term financial planning for athletes:\n\n- **NFL Career:** Strahan didn't just focus on his next game or season. He used his NFL earnings as a foundation for future wealth.\n- **Media Empire:** Post-retirement, he diversified into media, becoming a co-host on \"Live! with Kelly and Michael\" and \"Good Morning America.\"\n- **Business Ventures:** Strahan has invested in various businesses, including:\n  - A men's clothing line with J.C. Penney\n  - Production company (SMAC Entertainment)\n  - Endorsement deals with brands like Metamucil and Subway\n- **Real Estate:** He's invested in properties in New York and Los Angeles, diversifying his portfolio beyond liquid assets.\n- **Long-term Vision:** Strahan's approach demonstrates how to leverage athletic success into lasting financial security and diverse income streams.\n\n**USC Athlete Application:**\n\n- **Start Now:** Even small investments during your college years can grow significantly over time.\n- **Use NIL Opportunities:** If you have Name, Image, and Likeness deals, allocate a portion of that income to each of your goal timeframes.\n- **Think Beyond Sports:** Consider how your athletic skills and network can translate into business opportunities post-graduation.\n- **Seek Mentorship:** Connect with USC alumni who have successfully transitioned from athletics to business for guidance and inspiration."
